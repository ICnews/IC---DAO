# IC DAO – Tokenized Real Estate & Decentralized Investing

**IC DAO** is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the Solana blockchain, aiming to democratize real estate investing through **tokenization**, **on-chain governance**, and **community-driven decision-making**.

Our goal is to connect traditional real estate value with Web3 transparency — enabling anyone, anywhere, to invest in property markets directly from their wallet.
