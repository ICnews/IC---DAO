# IC DAO Governance Framework

## 🏛 Overview

IC DAO governance is designed to ensure **transparency, fairness, and decentralization** in all decision-making processes.  
Every $IC token holder has the right to participate in governance — to propose, discuss, and vote on key initiatives that shape the ecosystem.

Our governance model is powered by **Realms** on the **Solana blockchain**, providing on-chain voting, proposal tracking, and treasury transparency.

## 🔹 Governance Structure

| Role | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **DAO Council** | Group of multi-sig signers responsible for executing approved proposals. |
| **Token Holders** | All $IC holders can create and vote on proposals. |
| **Core Contributors** | Technical and community members maintaining DAO operations. |

---

## ⚙️ Voting Power

Voting power is determined by the number of **$IC tokens** held in a connected Solana wallet at the time of each proposal snapshot.

- 1 $IC = 1 vote  
- Voting snapshots are taken at the start of each proposal  
- Token holders can delegate votes to trusted members (delegation optional)

## 🗳 Proposal Lifecycle

1️⃣ **Draft Stage** – Community members submit a proposal outline via Discord or governance forum  
2️⃣ **Review & Feedback** – DAO members discuss feasibility and alignment  
3️⃣ **On-Chain Proposal** – Submitted via Realms using $IC tokens  
4️⃣ **Voting Period** – Minimum 3–5 days open voting window  
5️⃣ **Execution** – Approved proposals executed by the DAO Council multi-sig wallet

- **Accountability:** Decisions reflect collective voting power  
- **Inclusivity:** Every token holder can participate  
- **Sustainability:** Governance evolves as the DAO scales
